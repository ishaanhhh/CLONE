                <p>Santa Monica began work on the fifth main installment in 2014, which was confirmed by the returning Cory Barlog at the first annual PlayStation Experience on December 6 that year.[87] The official announcement came at the 2016 Electronic Entertainment Expo (E3) with a gameplay demo,[32] which also confirmed that Barlog had returned to the series as game director.[37] The game was deliberately titled God of War with no numeral or subtitle because although it is a continuation of the series, "we [reimagined] everything."[88][89] Other mythologies were also considered for the new setting, but Norse was picked to keep the focus on Kratos;[90] there was also consideration to use a different protagonist, but it was decided to keep Kratos as he "is intrinsically tied" to the series.[37] In adapting the Norse myths, Barlog said there were so many different translations and interpretations, and just like they did with Greek mythology in the previous games, they found ways to parallel path things from the myths to fit their story.[91] Most of the development team that worked on the original God of War worked on the new installment.[88] They claimed that they matched the new gameplay with the same level of accessibility as the previous installments.[54] Some gameplay characteristics found in the previous installments were cut, such as jumping.
